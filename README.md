# Indexer.exe
To utilize this system, you need to have a working file server. Designate one folder in your file server for containing the first version, and updates for your software. Place the Indexer.exe inside this folder. For this runthrough, I will use C:/WebHost/Updates/ as this folder. Now create a folder with a low revision number as the name like "0.0". Place all the folders and files for your first revision in that folder. For every update that you provide for your software, create a new folder with a higher revision number. Place all the files you changed since the last update in this new folder structured in the same way. Then run Indexer.exe.


To give you some visual aid, look at these photos. This is the Updates folder with the base revision in /0.1/, and all updates in the remaining folders.

As I have no software to give you an example with, I'll use some simple files. Assume my software was an image contained in a folder called Data/Graphics/ called Guy.png and a song called Song.m4a. In my 0.1 folder, it should look like this.

In my other patch files, I have a few changes that I made. I changed the file Song.m4a to a different song under the same name, I changed the file Guy.png to a different image under the same name, and I added a file called Song.mp3. Since I've uploaded a few patches, I need to run my Indexer.exe so that these patches take effect.

The Indexer takes into account all folders and files that are created, and stores all their revisions and path names into their respective files. It is very important that you run the Indexer after uploading any patch so that people who run the Updater will get the updates. It is also very important that you leave the folder where your updates are contained very clean. Otherwise, your clients might download files you didn't intend.

After you run the Indexer, you're all done on the server end.



# Updater.exe
